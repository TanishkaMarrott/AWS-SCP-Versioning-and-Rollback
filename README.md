# **GitOps Workflow for Version-Controlled SCPs using OIDC**

I'd be outlining the implementation of **version-controlled Service Control Policies (SCPs)** in a **large-scale AWS environment**, combining **GitOps**, **OIDC for secure authentication** & **Terraform** to automate deployments.

---

### **Step 1: Set Up OpenID Connect (OIDC) for GitHub-AWS Communication**

- **OIDC** securely connects GitHub Actions with AWS without using long-lived access keys.
  
  - **Create IAM roles** in AWS with a trust relationship to GitHubâ€™s OIDC provider, ensuring secure communication.
  
  - **Key Point**: This step ensures secure, short-lived credentials for GitHub Actions, reducing security risks.

---

### **Step 2: Store and Manage SCPs in a Git Repository**

- Store your SCP JSON files (e.g., `version_1.json`, `version_2.json`) under a **scp-policies** folder within your repository.

- Git is the **source of truth** for all SCP versions. Every update to an SCP is tracked via commits, ensuring full version control and auditability.

- **Key Point**: All SCP updates are tracked, making rollbacks and collaboration seamless.

---

### **Step 3: Set Up Terraform for SCP Management**

- **Terraform** is used to apply and manage SCPs across AWS accounts and OUs.

- The **Terraform configuration files** are stored under the **terraform** directory and reference the SCP files in **scp-policies**.

- **Key Point**: Terraform enables infrastructure as code (IaC), automating the consistent application of SCPs across environments.

---

### **Step 4: Automate with GitHub Actions**

- **GitHub Actions** automatically trigger on every **commit** or **pull request** to the **main** branch, running the following steps:

  1. **Terraform Init**
  2. **Terraform Format**
  3. **Terraform Validate**
  4. **Terraform Plan**
  5. **Terraform Apply**

- **OIDC** handles authentication between GitHub Actions and AWS, eliminating the need for static credentials.

- **Key Point**: Any commit or PR in Git automatically deploys changes to AWS, keeping infrastructure and code in sync.

---

### **Step 5: Rollbacks Using Git and Terraform**

- **Git is the source of truth**, meaning you can roll back SCPs easily through Git commands:

  1. Use `git log` to find the commit you want to revert.
  2. Run `git revert <commit-hash>` to undo changes.
  3. Push the changes (`git push origin main`), which will trigger GitHub Actions and revert the SCPs in AWS.

- **Key Point**: Using Git for rollbacks ensures you can revert to any previous version of an SCP and apply it seamlessly to AWS.

---

### **Step 6: Logging, Auditing, and Automation**

- **CloudTrail** logs all actions related to SCPs, ensuring visibility over changes.

- **CloudWatch** monitors for anomalies or policy violations and triggers alerts for immediate action.

- **Key Point**: Centralized logging and monitoring provide transparency and compliance with security standards.

---

### **Final Workflow Summary:**

1. **OIDC** provides secure authentication between GitHub and AWS.
2. **Git** is the single source of truth, tracking every SCP version.
3. **Terraform** ensures SCPs are applied and managed as code.
4. **GitHub Actions** automate deployments upon every commit or PR.
5. **Rollback** processes are simple via Git commands and Terraform.
6. **Logging** and **monitoring** ensure compliance and traceability across environments.

This is a **robust, secure, and scalable** GitOps workflow for managing version-controlled SCPs in AWS. It enables centralization, automation, and auditability while aligning with your strategic focus on governance, security & infrastructure consistency.
